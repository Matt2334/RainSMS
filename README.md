# RainSMS
I often forget to check the daily weather before leaving the house, and like many others I fail to take an umbrella with me. I created this project as a way to notify through an SMS that there will be rain and to serve as a reminder to be prepared for the poor weather. 

This script uses two main APIs. The first is OpenWeather which provides free weather data when providing the users latitude and longitude. With the OpenWeather API a user can specify if they want hourly, daily, weekly...etc weather data. The second is Twilio which provides the SMS service. All one needs to do is make an account for both OpenWeather and Twilio, generate/locate your Authentication tokens and input it into the capitalized portions in the script.
